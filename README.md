## Installation

### From Source

```bash
$ make && sudo make install
```

**Note:** On Windows you will need to move `lolcat-cc.exe` to a location searched by your path variable, for example try `C:\Windows\System32`.

## Why?

This `lolcat` clone was mostly to add limited rainbow support for Windows. It seems to be about twice as fast as `lolcat-c` on speed, both of which are an an entirely different league speed-wise compared to the original ruby version.

To benchmark them, an empty directory was filled with 100k files named `x.txt` where `x` goes from `1` to `100000`. From within the directory the following commands were run:

```bash
ls -l | time lolcat
ls -l | time lolcat-c
ls -l | time lolcat-cc -f
```

The results are in the following table:

| Tables           | lolcat(rb) | lolcat-c   | lolcat-cc  |
| ---------------- | ----------:| ----------:| ----------:|

## lolcat-cc output from shell 

The developer of `lolcat-cc` also created and develops [Nift](https://nift.dev) which has an in-built shell extension you can start with `nift sh` then you can turn on lolcat-cc output, including for tab completion suggestions, using [lolcat.on](https://nift.dev/docs/fns/lolcat.on.html).
