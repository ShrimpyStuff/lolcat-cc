## Installation
### From Source

```bash
$ make && sudo make install
```

**Note:** On Windows you will need to move `lolcat-cc.exe` to a location searched by your path variable, for example try `C:\Windows\System32`.

## Why?

This `lolcat` clone was mostly to add limited rainbow support for Windows. It's also \~5x as fast as lolcat-c and almost 400 times as fast as the original, and has a formatted option for things like not messing up emojis, some utf-8 characters, cleared lines, stripping unix colour codes etc..

To benchmark them, an empty directory was filled with 100k files named `x.txt` where `x` goes from `1` to `100000`. From within the directory the following commands were run:

```bash
ls -l | time lolcat
ls -l | time lolcat-c
ls -l | time lolcat-cc
```

The results are in the following table:
